      <p>Artist Statement: One of my themes in my BFA show is about personal Journey with influence of emotions.
        Different pathways we take as people in our journey in life always deal with the unknown.
        Creating new bridges and burning old ones help with our self growth.
        I made this scene as a  bridge being a metaphor  to my BFA show. I
        used of the three.js images folder of a bridge to create the notion of the viewer going through my portfolio,
        crossing over to this three.js preview of my models I used the show , and then eventually
        being able to click the link to the NAC website.
        You can orbit around the scene seeing a bright sunny day of a bridge by a body of water. </p>
